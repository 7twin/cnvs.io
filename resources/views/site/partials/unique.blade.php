        <div class="section-divider"></div>
        <p>Canvas is developed by a group of contributors all over the world who donate their time and skills to create a unique blogging platform for everyone. We all come from a different background in development, but together form a well-rounded team that excels at working together.</p>

        <p>Anyone is eligible to contribute to the project. In fact, we encourage young developers to jump in and cut their teeth on the many open source technologies implemented here.</p>

        <p> We all started somewhere. Why not start here?</p>
