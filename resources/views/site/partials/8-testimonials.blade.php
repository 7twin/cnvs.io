                                <p>For my first look at Canvas, I’m really impressed with the appearance of the admin. The installation is really straightforward, especially if you are comfortable with Laravel. If you are looking to start a blog this year, Canvas would be a good choice.</p>

                                <p>Canvas is a new mini-CMS aimed at developers who need personal blogs. If you’re looking for an easy-to-use, easy-to-set-up, and easy-to-deploy CMS, give Canvas a go and submit extensions and pull requests to expand its already very vibrant community.</p>

                                <p>Canvas rocks! I’ve tried building blogs from scratch and with other plug and play CMS’s, but nothing comes close to Canvas. Instead of worrying about grinding out the features a blog needs, you can focus on crafting a blog that tells your story. I now use Canvas exclusively for my blog development and I’ve never been happier.</p>
